# EcoCycle Sim

# ECocycle — E-Waste Collection & Recycling Management System

## Complete Simulation-Mode Master Prompt

You are a senior software architect, UI/UX designer, full-stack engineer, database architect, QA engineer, simulation-system designer, and DevOps engineer.

Build a complete **E-Waste Collection & Recycling Management System called "EcoCycle"**.

IMPORTANT:

This is a **100% SIMULATION / DEMONSTRATION SYSTEM**.

The application must simulate the complete e-waste lifecycle without performing real-world operations.

==================================================

1. SIMULATION MODE — ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT
   ==================================================

The entire application must operate in SIMULATION MODE.

Do NOT connect to or depend on real-world operational services.

The following must be simulated:

* pickup requests
* collection agents
* customer locations
* GPS positions
* maps
* route movement
* pickup scheduling
* e-waste weights
* collection centers
* inventory
* recycling facilities
* recycling processes
* recovered materials
* environmental impact
* reward points
* notifications
* emails
* SMS
* WhatsApp
* certificates
* reports
* payments
* coupons
* analytics
* IoT devices
* smart bins
* sensor readings
* external APIs
* external recycling organizations

The application must remain fully functional even with:

* no internet connection
* no Google Maps API
* no payment gateway
* no SMS provider
* no WhatsApp API
* no email provider
* no IoT devices
* no external recycling API

==================================================
2. SIMULATION PRINCIPLE
=======================

Every real-world action should have a simulated equivalent.

Example:

REAL WORLD:
Customer requests pickup.

SIMULATION:
Create a database pickup request and simulate the workflow.

REAL WORLD:
Agent travels to customer.

SIMULATION:
Animate the agent's simulated location moving toward the pickup location.

REAL WORLD:
Agent weighs e-waste.

SIMULATION:
Generate or enter simulated weight.

REAL WORLD:
Waste reaches recycling facility.

SIMULATION:
Move inventory into a simulated collection center.

REAL WORLD:
Recycler processes material.

SIMULATION:
Run a deterministic or configurable recycling simulation.

REAL WORLD:
Customer receives SMS.

SIMULATION:
Create an in-app simulated notification.

==================================================
3. SIMULATION BANNER
====================

Display a persistent visual indicator:

"SIMULATION MODE"

Example:

┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🧪 SIMULATION MODE                          │
│ All data and operations are simulated.      │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Never imply that an actual pickup, recycling operation,
payment, certificate, or environmental result has occurred.

Use terms such as:

* Simulated
* Demo
* Estimated
* Example
* Simulated Result

where appropriate.

==================================================
4. NO REAL EXTERNAL INTEGRATIONS
================================

Do NOT require API keys.

Do NOT require:

Google Maps
Mapbox
Twilio
WhatsApp
Stripe
Razorpay
SendGrid
AWS
Firebase
IoT platforms
Real recycling APIs
Real payment APIs

If such functionality is demonstrated, implement it through
local mock services.

Create interfaces so real services could theoretically be
added later, but the default implementation must always be a
simulation provider.

Example:

MapProvider
├── SimulationMapProvider
└── RealMapProvider (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

NotificationProvider
├── SimulationNotificationProvider
└── RealNotificationProvider (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

PaymentProvider
└── SimulationPaymentProvider

==================================================
5. SIMULATION ENGINE
====================

Create a dedicated simulation engine.

Suggested structure:

/lib/simulation/

simulation-engine.ts
simulation-config.ts
simulation-clock.ts
simulation-random.ts
simulation-data.ts
simulation-workflows.ts
simulation-location.ts
simulation-recycling.ts
simulation-rewards.ts
simulation-notifications.ts

The simulation engine should be responsible for generating
realistic but fictional system behavior.

==================================================
6. SIMULATION CLOCK
===================

Implement a simulated clock.

The simulation must NOT depend on real-world waiting times.

Provide controls:

▶ Start Simulation
⏸ Pause
⏩ Speed 2x
⏩ Speed 5x
⏩ Speed 10x
⏭ Advance Event
🔄 Reset Simulation

Example:

Simulation Time:
25 September 2026
10:42 AM

Simulation Speed:
5x

The system should allow an entire pickup workflow to be
completed within seconds/minutes.

or:

environment = "SIMULATION"

The application must reject attempts to create non-simulated
operational records.

==================================================
36. SIMULATION DATA ISOLATION
=============================

All demo records must be clearly separated from any potential
future production records.

Use:

environment = SIMULATION

throughout relevant entities.

Never mix simulation and production data.

If production mode is ever implemented later, it must require
explicit configuration.

Default:

SIMULATION_ONLY=true

==================================================
37. API
=======

Create simulated APIs.

Examples:

POST /api/simulation/start

POST /api/simulation/scenario

GET /api/simulation/status
GET /api/simulation/events
GET /api/simulation/clock

POST /api/simulation/pickups
POST /api/simulation/pickups/:id/run

POST /api/simulation/sorting/:id/run
POST /api/simulation/recycling/:id/run

POST /api/simulation/rewards/:id/simulate
POST /api/simulation/certificate/:id/generate

All APIs must return simulated data.

Absolutely no:

* real payment
* real purchase
* real donation
* real pickup
* real delivery
* real recycling booking
* real GPS tracking
* real communication

Scenario:

"Aarav wants to recycle an old laptop."

Step 1:
Aarav creates simulated pickup.

Step 2:
System assigns EcoAgent 01.

Step 3:
Agent moves toward simulated location.

Step 4:
Agent collects laptop.

Step 5:
Simulated weight = 2.8 KG.

Step 6:
Center receives laptop.

Step 7:

* credit rewards

E2E:

Launch Demo
→ Customer Pickup
→ Agent Movement
→ Collection
→ Inventory
→ Batch
→ Recycling
→ Certificate
→ Reward

✓ Documentation is complete

FINAL PRINCIPLE:

Build a realistic, polished, fully functional e-waste management
SIMULATOR.

The system should feel like a real enterprise e-waste management
platform while making it absolutely clear that every operation,
location, measurement, transaction, notification, recycling result,
certificate, reward, and environmental metric is simulated.

Never perform or imply a real-world transaction.
Never require real external services.
Never represent simulation results as actual recycling results.

Prioritize:

1. Functionality
2. Simulation realism
3. Data consistency
4. UX
5. Security
6. Reproducibility
7. Demonstration quality
8. Maintainability
